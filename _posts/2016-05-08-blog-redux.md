After many, many years, I've decided to start blogging again. Topics will mostly cover building systems on and around Python, with some flavor from the technology industry at large.

My goals are twofold:

* provide (hopefully) useful information for anyone who might enjoy it
* build a (hopefully positive) reputation, rather than being an internet basement-dweller

Stay tuned!

My name is Travis Mehlinger. I'm a Python developer and systems nerd in Allen, Texas.

I specialize in developing, testing, and operating backend Python applications. I love Flask and SQLAlchemy and I couldn't live without pytest. I live for automation.

I currently work on [Loop](https://loopk12.com/) by Dewsly. We make a communication platform for school districts that makes it easy for teachers to connect with students and parents. Check it out!
